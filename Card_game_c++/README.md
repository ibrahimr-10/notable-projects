This card game involves two players taking turns to play cards from their boards, each containing 5 cards drawn from a deck. Cards can be "power plus" (adds value to player’s score), "power minus" (subtracts value from opponent’s score), or "steal" (takes a card from the opponent). Players generate their decks by typing card types and values. The game ends when one player has no cards left, and the highest score wins. Players choose cards and their values 20 times, with the computer selecting cards automatically from the deck. The goal is to achieve the highest score.
