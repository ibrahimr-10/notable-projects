These jupiter notebook files are for my Data Driven Artificial Intelligence coursework. They were both completed in Google Colab and in "Coursework1" I was tasked with predicting hotel bookings that could get cancelled. "Coursework2" more interestingly, showcases the development of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for image classification that is capable of predicting hand washing stages in relation to covid-19. In this Assignemnt, I had to deal with a dataset of over 5000 images where I applied various data pre-processing techniques to ensure data integrity and model robustness.
