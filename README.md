The files above show some of the projects that I have worked on. "Web_Programming_Code" is in a zip file as I was not able to upload it like the other files. This assignment was about developing a web client-server application with a basic API Gateway and a NO-SQL database using REDIS.

I have also added README files to the sub-sections to explain a little bit more about the projects completed.
